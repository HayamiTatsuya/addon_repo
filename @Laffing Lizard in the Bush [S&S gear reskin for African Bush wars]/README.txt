Simply put, this was a little fun project for a mission with my friends and should offer people a good non-CDLC required option for African Bush War uniforms. There's some great mods already out there that covers the period but they tend to require GM, which not everybody's got. Initially my attention was on the Angolan War and Cuban Grey Lizard camo, but it expanded to just anything I thought looked neat and could find camo to work with.

The accuracy is versimilitude rather than precise. I tried to balance a matter of "looks like real life pictures/recreations I see", "has proper blood overlay", "Works with the webbing I want to use".


[b]Content of Mod:[/b]
1) Cuban Grey Lizard, roughly three different patterns/shades of it.

2) Various guerilla/rebel movement associated gear, being mixes of camo/no camo often of the Eastern block (German raindrop, Czech Sumpf, ect.)

3) Some French Lizard camo

4) SADF Nutria and 32 Batallion Camo

5) Rhodesian Camo

6) Belgian Camos

7) Portuguese Camos, although as this one was difficult while I sampled patterns from Portuguese gear they might just work as generalized lizard/brushstroke vertical patterns you found all across Africa.

8) There’s some new stuff, both the frogskin stuff I forgot to note and also “BL-IRREG” for some more frogskin and takistani. Credits are the same as before

[b]Issues[/b]:
-Black smudge in crotch area of certain outfits. I dunno what's causing it.
-The items might double when you access the regular arsenal, not the ace arsenal. I am not sure what's causing that at present.

[b]Credits[/b]: I honestly did very little, S&S' PSDs made this infinitely easier. So ultimately credit them for all their hard work, this was just some quick texture shenanigans.

-Service and Supply deserve all the credit for the original models and even sharing the PSDs that made this possible. Their work is phenomenal and we are lucky to have them.
-The Reddit camo discord and the old facepunch camo library. Some of the camos were of unknown authorization, but the ones with clear authors and clear permission granted are credited to Dan Marsden II (A rhodesian brushstroke). Ones of unknown author included Portuguese-ish lizard camo, Greek lizard camo, KLMK pattern, Czech Sumpf and others.
-Kommandopost the website for various Cuban Grey Lizard camo, Portuguese Lizard camo, Belgian Brushstroke and others.
-FIngolfin's NVA DDR Blumetarn camo.
-I do not think I missed anyone, but please let me know if I did and I will rectify that issue.
